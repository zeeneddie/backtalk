"""The mouth — streaming sentence-chunked TTS, played through one
long-lived output stream.

Default engine: Kokoro, in-process. Local, free, no server, no API key,
~0.2s to first audio once warm. Optional premium engine: ElevenLabs on
YOUR key — read from the system keychain, never from a file (see
_get_elevenlabs_key) — with Kokoro as the automatic fallback: the voice
degrades instead of going mute if the cloud fails.

Sentences are synthesized one at a time and queued for playback, so the
first sentence is audible while later ones are still rendering. Playback
is cancellable mid-word: set the stop event and the speaker goes silent
within one audio block plus the device buffer (~0.15s).

HARD-WON AUDIO LAW #1 — ONE long-lived OutputStream, reused for every
sentence for the life of the process. A fresh stream per sentence gives
an audible onset blip or a beat of dead air on plenty of audio setups
(USB interfaces, Bluetooth, streaming mixers that latch onto each new
stream late). Proven by A/B test; do not "simplify" this away.

HARD-WON AUDIO LAW #2 — buffer ~0.75s of synthesized audio before a
sentence starts playing, so a slower machine never underruns into
slow-motion garble.
